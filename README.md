# Rockfell
This is a small 2D game with a custom engine utilizing SDL2 for rendering.

It should be cross-platform but has only been tested on Windows so far.

# Building
Requires SDL2 and SDL2_image to be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/IntriguingTiles/rockfell.git
cd rockfell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
